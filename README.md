## 📇 About The Project

This project is inspired by Facebook's Temporary Profile Picture, as well as the Twitter Space's logo when someone is joining a Space. Thus, I've created this apps to swap your plain Twitter picture to fit the **season/event/anything** that you want your follower to notice!

After a certain amount of period (you can configure on the app), it will automatically **swap back** (hence, Swappy) to your original image. And you can revisit the app when you feel like putting on another badges in the future.
